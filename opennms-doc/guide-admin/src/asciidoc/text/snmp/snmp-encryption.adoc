=== Encrypting SNMP Credentials

SNMP credentials like readCommunity/WriteCommunity, authPassPhrase/privPassPhrase can be saved on the file system in encrypted format.

==== Enabling encrypting on SNMP Config

Specifying a key for encryption would enable encryption on SNMP config.
[source, sh]
----
echo 'org.opennms.snmp.encryption.key=abc12345' >> "$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/opennms.properties.d/snmp-encryption.properties"
----

SNMP config that is modified on User Interface will be encrypted directly on file system.
Config that is updated on the file system needs to be saved with karaf command `opennms-snmp:save-config` to get encrypted.

NOTE: Currently, SNMP config encryption is not supported on the snmp profiles.
